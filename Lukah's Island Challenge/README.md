# Lukah's Island Survival Challenge

## Map
[Lukah's Island](https://farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=fi&mod_id=201911) of Course!

## Mods
A lot. All can be found on either the official ModHub or fs19.net - with
most or all of the ones from the latter site also being available on
modhub.us if you prefer that site. See the [Mods List](##-mods-list) section.

## Goal

### Solo
Reach 2.5m+ Money  
Process a minmum of 100 trees into lumber at the sawmill

### Multiplayer
Reach 10m+ Money  
Process a minmum of 300 trees into lumber at the sawmill

## Rules
1. Only the provided (listed) mods are allowed.
2. Must start from the provided save game.
3. Store is hidden (can still be accessed from menu) because you're not allowed to purchase anything.
4. Log cabin home can be purchased for $10,000. It is the only exception to the previous rule. However, it has conditions:  
-- 4a. Must harvest and sell a minimum of 25 trees prior to purchasing the cabin. Lumberjack mod will be enabled for stump removal.  
-- 4b. Must place it in a location that is not a numbered field or in the roadway.  
5. Equipment will be scattered and hidden throughout the island. Some of the equipment will need to be repaired before it can be used, other pieces not.  
-- 5a. The equipment is intended to be hidden. Must load another game first, and turn off all tractor, trailer, implement, harvester, etc... icons for player equipment in order to force the setting since it is shared
 for all savegames. Once this is done, save and exit that game. Then you can load this game. Failure to do so defeats the purpos of the challenge.  
6. No super strength.
7. No workers  
-- 7a. Instead of No Workers, you may hire up to 3 workers and go for the multiplayer goals.  
-- 7b. You may do 7a by adding the [Contractor Mod](https://farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=fi&mod_id=108748) and setting it to have from 2-4 characters  
8. MP version of challenge limited to 4 players, but works best with just 2.
9. Cannot change settings to turn visibility of equipment back on
10. Headers can only be used on the combine that they match, which should be easy to tell from the paint & style

## Background
You're a survivor (or group of survivors in multiplayer) of a shipwreck.
You've washed up on the beach of this island, coming ashore where you saw
some buildings on the way in. Despite the obvious buildings, the island
appears to be uninhabited, and much of what you find is damaged or
destroyed. However, there is some operable farming equipment. There are
fields that have been growing random and wild with no one to maintain them.
Additionally there are animals that have survived as well: sheep and
chickens.

## Equipment, and why is it such an eclectic mix?
The previous inhabitants of the island purchased whatever they could get,
from whomever would sell it to them. Equipment from the former Soviet Union,
from Germany, from the USA, and from many others as well. Additionally, it
has been collected for decades. A lot of the stuff dates back to World Warn II.
Nothing is more modern than the 1980s as far as can be told from a cursory
look around the island.

## Platform Support
Computer Only, due to the mods used and being started from a savegame.
